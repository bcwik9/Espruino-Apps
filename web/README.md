# http_server.js
A simple HTTP server.

## Additional Notes
A server should be running. Get the IP of the ESP8266 (look at your router's DHCP client list), and navigate to that in a web browser in port 3000 (or whatever you set it to). It should look something like `192.168.0.100:3000`. A page should load.
